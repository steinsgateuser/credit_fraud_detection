 ## Credit-Default-Prediction

 Loan default prediction is critical for financial institutions offering lending services. When borrowers cannot repay their loans, it can significantly impact the institution’s financial stability and reputation.
In general, loan default prediction is a challenging problem for several reasons. Firstly many factors can influence a borrower’s ability to repay a loan, including their credit score, income, employment history, and more. Secondly, there is often a high degree of variability in the data, as borrowers come from various backgrounds and circumstances. Thirdly, loan defaults are relatively rare, making it difficult to train machine learning (ML) models on them.

## OBJECTIVE

 We aim to compare the accuracy of different algorithms and identify the best model for default prediction. This work addresses the challenge of finding a suitable ML model by thoroughly evaluating various algorithms for loan default prediction. Specifically, we apply ML algorithms to a single dataset of loan information and then identify the ML algorithm that provides the most accurate predictions of loan defaults. The results of this project will provide financial institutions with a powerful tool for managing their risk and preventing loan defaults.
